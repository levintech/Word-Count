# Word-Count
 
  ## Overview
  In this project, you'll write a program to calculate and display the number of times each word appears in Life, the Universe and Everything! (or any other book). In the process, you'll get to practice almost all the Python skills you have acquired over the course, including command-line arguments, file input-output, strings and string methods, functions, lists and dictionaries, custom sorting, loops and if-statements. Let's get started!

        It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was
        damp  and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle
